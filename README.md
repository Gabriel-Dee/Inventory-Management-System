# Inventory-Management-System
A medical inventory system is a software application designed to manage the flow of medical supplies and equipment in and out of a medical store. This system allows the medical store to keep track of their inventory levels, to ensure that they have enough supplies to meet the needs of their patients while minimizing waste and avoiding stockouts.
